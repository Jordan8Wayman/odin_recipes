        <p> <h2>Description</h2>
        Creamy, comforting, and deliciously wholesome, our Cauliflower Alfredo Bake reimagines a classic favorite with a lighter twist. 
        Roasted cauliflower florets are smothered in a velvety, garlic-infused Alfredo sauce made from blended cauliflower and savory seasonings. 
        Baked with layers of cheese until bubbly and golden, this dish delivers rich flavor and satisfying textureâ€”without the heaviness. 
        Perfect as a hearty main or a decadent side.</p>
